# SOP 03: Direct Referral

## Trigger

## Overview
When an existing referrer submits a direct referral (someone they know personally), review and reach out to the potential creator.

---

## Steps

### 1. Review the Referral
Open the email notification and note:
- [ ] **Referrer Name** - Who submitted this? (Should be existing referrer)
- [ ] **Referrer Email** - Contact info for follow-up questions
- [ ] **Referral Name** - The potential creator
- [ ] **Referral Phone** - Best contact method
- [ ] **Referral Email** - Alternative contact
- [ ] **Referral Instagram** - Check their profile
- [ ] **Relationship** - How does the referrer know them?
- [ ] **Notes** - Any special information from the referrer

### 2. Verify the Referrer
1. Open [Google Sheets - Referrers tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kCFAavAsfbb3p-cNTxudFh6eMd3uOHxkYJrAZqgCpRE)
2. Confirm the referrer exists and is active
3. Note their referrer code (you'll need this if the referral becomes a model)

### 3. Check Instagram Profile
1. Look up the referral's Instagram
2. Assess:
   - Follower count
   - Content type
   - Activity level
   - Age (must be 18+)

### 4. Reach Out to Referral

#### If Looks Promising:
1. Use [Email Templates - Direct Referral Outreach](../email-templates.md#direct-referral-outreach)
2. Send via email or Instagram DM (whichever seems more active)
3. Mention that [Referrer Name] recommended them
4. Invite them to apply or schedule a call

#### If Not a Fit:
1. Thank the referrer for the submission
2. Explain why it's not a match (tactfully)
3. Encourage them to keep sending referrals

### 5. Track the Referral
In Direct Referrals tab, add tracking columns:
- **Status**: Contacted / Responded / Not Interested / Onboarding / Started / Not a Fit
- **Last Contact Date**: When you last reached out
- **Next Action**: What to do next

### 6. Follow Up
- If no response after 3 days, follow up once
- If still no response after 7 days, mark as "No Response"
- Keep referrer updated on progress (optional but builds relationship)

### 7. When Referral Becomes a Model
If the referral completes onboarding and starts:
1. Add them to the **Models** sheet with the referrer's code
2. The automation will notify the referrer automatically
3. Update Direct Referrals status to "Started"
